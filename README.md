### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


In this challenge I  learned the  CSS element (order) which can be used to switch HTML contents without changing the markup 


```css
 .stats-content-container {
    order: -1;
  }
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

CSS Grid
Like i said in my previous tasks css grid is what im looking to concentrate more on.
